This is partly the reproduction of the paper of [Mean Field Game Guided Deep Reinforcement Learning for Task Placement in Cooperative Multi-Access Edge Computing](IEEE IEEE Internet of Things Journal 2020 paper).
We establish this framework based on MorvanZhou's work (https://github.com/MorvanZhou/Reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow/tree/master/contents/9_Deep_Deterministic_Policy_Gradient_DDPG), where we mainly add the MFG module.
