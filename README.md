This is partly the reproduction of the paper of [Mean Field Game Guided Deep Reinforcement Learning for Task Placement in Cooperative Multi-Access Edge Computing](IEEE https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ezproxy.lib.uh.edu/document/9049116) published with IEEE Internet of Things Journal.

We establish this framework based on [MorvanZhou's work](https://github.com/MorvanZhou/Reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow/tree/master/contents/9_Deep_Deterministic_Policy_Gradient_DDPG).

This is a joint work with [Dian Shi](https://github.com/shidian117/MFDDPG)
